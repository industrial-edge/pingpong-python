## QuickStart

If you want to run everything locally with single command just run `docker-compose up -d` and open webpage on [localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880) and import [flows](SFC-flows/Pingpong-testing.json).

## Description

This application example demonstrates how Industrial Edge application can communicate with Databus using MQTT protocol. The goal is to send a string "Ping" message to Databus (MQTT broker) to a topic "topic1" and subscribe to MQTT topic "topic2" which should return "Pong python". The return message is generated by this python application. You can play virtual ping pong using this application!

### Overview

Ready to use application example can be downloaded on [Industrial Edge GitHub repository](https://github.com/industrial-edge/ping-pong-python) in the [releases section](https://github.com/industrial-edge/ping-pong-python/releases) called PingPongApplicationExample_x.x.x.app.zip. After unzipping this file you can directly import the .app file to your Industrial Edge Management system.

The release section also includes a docker base image that was used for this application example. The base image is included here for legal reasons.

A picture bellow shows the application data flow and architecture from the docker container point of view.

## Installation

You have two options how to install this app into Industrial Edge Management system. You can either use the [Direct Import section](#direct-import) to reuse .app we build for you or you can follow the [Complete Installation](#complete-installation) section to create the .app yourself.

### Direct Import steps

1. Import .app application available at [GitHub](https://github.com/industrial-edge/ping-pong-python/releases) to your Industrial Edge Management using one of the two options
   1. Industrial Edge App Publisher (recommended)
   2. Catalog import functionality
2. Install the imported app to onboarded Industrial Edge Device
3. Follow the configuration steps in [Installation guide](docs/Installation.md).

### Complete Installation

Comprehensive instructions for building and installing this application is available in the [Installation guide](docs/Installation.md).

## Usage

### Dependencies

In order for this application to run properly on Industrial Edge Device (IED), the following two applications must be installed and configured on the IED

- Databus application
- Flow Creator application

For detailed explanation have a look in the [Installation guide](docs/Installation.md) in the Testing section.
